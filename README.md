# Who am I?

Hey my name is Nika and I am an iOS/macOS/watchOS Software Engineer. Today, I'd like to share something happened to me recently.

I became an iOS Software Engineer in 2012, since then, I developed many iOS/macOS/watchOS apps. Some of them are products of the company that I work for, others were developed by myself. 

At the same time I am working as a Lecturer / Trainer of iOS development already worked with 400+ students, last time I was leading and training iOS Development Bootcamp during 4 months where there was 20 students and now from them 17 are junior Developers in Space neo bank, TBC bank and in other companies.

I am not trying to show off, but in the past few years, I have built a good reputation in the industry, at least in my country. 

# What happened?

Few weeks ago, I received an email from Apple, I was told that my developer membership has been terminated, this is a huge blow to me, apparently.

The letter says that I have fraudulent conduct, but I believe that's not true.

Apple just sent warning message to me and after 14 days removed all my apps at the same time.

I am disappointed, of course. But a more important issue is that I don't know what went wrong, and how to fix it. Tried to communicate with them but always was getting same generic words and texts but nothing concrete.

Apple is super confident about their judgment, they applied the most serious punishment to me, without mentioning any details.

# What I need?

For sure, from 2012 to 2021, it wasn't too long, also not too short. I am already kind of tired, and Apple says: hey, get out! I think it's not a bad idea for both of us.

However, could you please tell me the specific reason? I don't want to leave like a bad person! I have to figure out what's wrong.

Even I want to move forward for something else, I want the last piece on my mind of the entire journey is pleasant, not something like this.

If you have any resources that could help, I appreciate if you contact me with: nikakirkitadze@icloud.com Thank you!

# One more thing!

I don't feel so sorry about this, since I have done many interesting things in the past few years, it's pretty much enough for me. But I still want to share and give the knowledge to my pupils, crate and publish great apps

The things happened to me, it will happen again to another indie hacker some day, who knows?
