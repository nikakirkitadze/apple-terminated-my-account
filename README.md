# Who am I?

Hey, my name is Nika, and I am an iOS/macOS/watchOS Software Engineer. Today, I'd like to share something that happened to me recently.

I became an iOS Software Engineer in 2012. Since then, I have developed many iOS/macOS/watchOS apps. Some of them are products of the company that I work for. Others were created by myself.

At the same time, I am working as a Lecturer / Trainer of iOS development already worked with 400+ students, last time I was leading and training iOS Development Bootcamp for four months, there were 20 students, and now from them, 17 are junior Developers in Space neo bank, TBC bank and other companies.

I am not trying to show off, but in the past few years, I have built a good reputation in the industry, at least in my country.

# What happened?

A few weeks ago, I received an email from Apple, where says that my developer membership has terminated. This is a massive blow to me.

The letter says that I have fraudulent conduct, but I believe that's not true.

Apple just sent a warning message to me and, after 14 days, removed all my apps at the same time.

I am disappointed, of course. But a more critical issue is that I don't know what went wrong and how to fix it. I tried to communicate with them but always was getting exact generic words and texts but nothing concrete.

Apple is super confident about its judgment. They applied the most severe punishment to me, without mentioning any details.

# What I need?

For sure, from 2012 to 2021, it wasn't too long, also not too short. I am already kind of tired, and Apple says: hey, get out! I think it's not a bad idea for both of us.

However, could you please tell me the specific reason? I don't want to leave like a bad person! I have to figure out what's wrong.

Even I want to move forward with something else. I want the last piece on my mind of the entire journey is pleasant, not something like this.

If you have any resources that could help, I appreciate it if you contact me with nikakirkitadze@icloud.com. Thank you!

# One more thing!

I don't feel so sorry about this, since I have done many exciting things in the past few years, it's pretty much enough for me. But I still want to share and give the knowledge to my pupils, crate and publish great apps

The things that happened to me will happen again to another indie hacker someday. Who knows?
